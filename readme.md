## Eccomerence Store Application  with Backend in NodeJS and MongoDB
Welcome to our Eccomerence-Store-backend  project! This repository houses the backend functionality for our Eccomerence-store-application, enabling users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. Our server is built on Express, interacts with dynamic data stored in MongoDB, and follows the REST API architecture along with the MVC design pattern.

## Features
**CRUD Operations:** Users can seamlessly Create, Read, Update, and Delete products through our RESTful API endpoints.

**Express Framework:** Leveraging the power of Express, our backend provides robust routing and middleware support for handling requests.

**MongoDB Integration:** Dynamic product data is stored and managed efficiently in MongoDB, offering scalability and flexibility.

**MVC Design Pattern:** We've structured our codebase following the Model-View-Controller design pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

**Scalable Architecture:** Designed with scalability in mind, our backend architecture can easily accommodate growing data and user demands.
